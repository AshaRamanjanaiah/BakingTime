# Baking Time App

## Project Overview

In this project, I have created an app to view video recipes. I have handled media loading, verify user interfaces with UI tests, and integrate third party libraries. I have also provide a complete user experience with a home screen widget.


## Project Details

I have created an app that will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

One of the skills I have learned in this project is how to handle unexpected input in the data -- professional developers often cannot expect polished JSON data when building an app.


## What did I Learn?

In this project I have learnt:

1. Using MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
2. Handling error cases in Android.
3. Adding a widget to app experience.
4. Leveraging a third-party library in this app.
5. Using Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
6. Creating recyclerviews with adapters.
7. Creating listview inside widget. 
8. Enabling communication between App and widget.

### Libraries used: 

1. Exoplayer to display videos.
2. Espresso(UI tests) to verify user interfaces.
3. Butterknife to initialize views.
4. Retrofit to get data over network.
5. GSON which parses JSON into Java objects.
6. Picasso to load images in the application.
